# WarCraft III

## What does randomization do to this game?

The following unlocks are randomized as items:
1. The available missions.
2. Your ability to build any non-worker unit.
3. Your ability to research unit upgrades.
4. Race-specific worker abilities
5. Your ability to research weapon and armor upgrades
6. Hero abilities
7. Starting items in each mission
8. Small boosts to your starting gold and lumber in each mission

You receive a small cache of random items upon starting the game.  You may unlock additional items by:
* Completing missions (three items awarded per mission victory)
* Completing bonus objectives
* Optionally, completing missions through optional, difficult victory conditions

These restrictions are enforced manually using cheats.
- The player must unlock all technology from a mission using the "synergy" cheat
- The player can load in their starting resources using the "greedisgood X" cheat, where X is their starting resources.
- The player must only use technologies they've unlocked through AP, and must only level up abilities they've received through AP.

## What is the goal of this game when randomized?

The goal is to complete all of the missions in the campaign.
